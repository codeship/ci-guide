## intro

One of the most essential parts of any CI process is running your tests. With Codeship's Jet tool for Docker, we wanted to make building your CI/CD pipeline easy - so we made iterating through, debugging and improving your tests both locally and remotely after you push, as straightforward as we could.

## running your tests

Let's go back in to our code example for a minute and add a simple, passing test.

In our case, we're just going to check for an existent environmental variable. This isn't a particularly real-world scenario, but it will help demonstrate exactly what Codeship does with your tests and what you should look for.

So, first we're going to...

### Create an environment variable

Opening up our **codeship-services.yml**, we'll add the following:

```
demo:
  build:
    image: myapp
    dockerfile_path: Dockerfile
  links:
    - redis
    - postgres
  environment:
    TEST_TOKEN: Testing123
```

This new **environment** directive creates a new environment variable in our build named `TEST_TOKEN`. Note that even though we're explicitly declaring our environment variables here, in a production application we'd actual prefer to [encrypt them](https://codeship.com/documentation/docker/encryption/).

### Look for the variable

With our environment variable set, let's write a test to look for it.

Create a new file called **test.rb** and open up it. In our new file, we'll write:

```
if ENV['TEST_TOKEN'].nil?
   puts "Our Variable Is Not Working"
   exit 1
else
   puts "Our Variable Is Working"
   exit 0
 end
```

What we're doing here is checking to see if our new environment variable is nil. If it is, we have a problem and we exit with a status code 1 to let the CI/CD process know we have an error. If it's not nil, we're in business and we exit with a status code 0 to indicate a success.

### Update Steps

Now that we have a working test script, we need to run it. Let's open up our **codeship-steps.yml** file and modify it to the following:

```
- type: parallel
  steps:
    - name: checkrb
      service: demo
      command: bundle exec ruby check.rb
    - name: test
      service: demo
      command: bundle exec ruby test.rb
```

As you can see we're now running our two scripts under a new **parallel** modifier. This means they will run side-by-side on separate containers, letting us move through multiple steps in our pipeline more quickly.

### Run and see!

Now, after configuring your tests, let's go back to your terminal and run ```jet steps```

This will run your CI process as defined in **codeship-steps.yml**.

You should see something like this indicating our tests ran and passed:

## after testing, push images and/or deploy!

So, now we have images building, a working script and a working test! The next step is to move from CI to CD: [pushing images and deploying your code.](part3)
